### Running the Application

You'll need to run two processes in separate terminals: the backend API server and the frontend React application.

    ```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3002`, and the API server will be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
# Add your OpenWeatherMap and TomTom API keys here if needed

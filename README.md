# Events Planner: Because Who Needs Chaos When You Can Have Controlled Mayhem?

Welcome to **Events Planner**, the React-powered web app that's here to turn your wildest party dreams into realityâ€”or at least into something that doesn't end with the cops being called. Tired of planning events that flop harder than a bad magician's trick? Fear not! This app is your digital sidekick for organizing weddings, corporate shindigs, and everything in between.

## What's This Madness About?

Imagine a world where planning an event is as easy as scrolling through cat videos on your phone. That's Events Planner! Built with React (because vanilla JS is so last season), this app lets users sign up, log in, and dive into a dashboard where they can book events faster than you can say "open bar."

Key features include:
- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in, because who wants strangers crashing your event planning party?
- **Dashboard**: Your personal command center for booking events. Add, view, and delete bookings like a boss.
- **Home Page**: A flashy landing page with hero sections, partner logos, and enough buzzwords to make your head spin. "Turning Moments Into Memories!!" â€“ because clichÃ©s are our love language.
- **About & Contact**: Learn about us (we're awesome) and get in touch via WhatsApp or the contact form.
- **Backend Simulation**: Powered by json-server, so you get that sweet, sweet API feel without the hassle of a real backend. It's like dating a hologram â€“ exciting but not too committed.

## Tech Stack: The Cool Kids' Table

- **Frontend**: React 19 (the latest and greatest, because we like living on the edge)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for navigating between pages without getting lost
- **Styling**: CSS (because Tailwind is for quitters)
- **Icons**: React Icons for that extra flair
- **Backend Mock**: json-server running on port 3000, serving up fake data like it's nobody's business
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library, because bugs are the enemy

## How to Run This Bad Boy

1. Clone the repo (or don't, we won't judge).
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the mock server: `npm run server` (runs json-server on port 3000)
4. In another terminal, start the app: `npm start` (runs on port 3001, because why not?)
5. Or, for the lazy: `npm run dev` to run both concurrently. Boom!

## Fun Facts

- Over 10,000 active members? Probably. We rounded up.
- 30+ experts? Sure, why not. They might be imaginary, but they're enthusiastic.
- Partners include big names like Safaricom, Toyota, and even Kenya itself. We're connected, baby!

## Disclaimer

This app is for planning events, not for planning your escape from reality. If your event turns into a disaster, blame the caterer, not us. And remember, "Celebrate Every Occasion with Style" â€“ but if your style is chaos, we're here for it.

Now go forth and plan some unforgettable events. Or at least some mildly memorable ones. Cheers! ðŸŽ‰
